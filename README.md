This project implements a **Dot Graph Solver** for a color path connection puzzle, inspired by games like *Flow Free*. The objective is to connect pairs of colored dots on a grid using paths of the same color that fill the entire grid without overlapping. The solver employs a backtracking algorithm with Manhattan distance heuristics for efficient pathfinding and includes a Pygame-based GUI for visual representation.

The system handles puzzles of various grid sizes (e.g., 6x6) with multiple colored dot pairs, outputting the solution process in the console and displaying the final configuration graphically. It's suitable for puzzle enthusiasts, algorithm researchers, or developers interested in constraint satisfaction and pathfinding problems.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project solves a grid-based puzzle where:
- Grid cells can be empty, colored dots, or parts of colored paths.
- Each pair of same-colored dots must be connected via a continuous path of that color.
- Paths must not overlap, and the grid must be fully filled for a valid solution.
- The backtracking solver prioritizes moves based on Manhattan distance and recent actions to optimize exploration.
- A Pygame GUI renders the grid with distinct colors for paths and dots.

Key highlights:
- Heuristic-driven backtracking for quick solutions.
- Connectivity validation using DFS (Depth-First Search).
- Support for customizable puzzles via input dictionaries.
- Console output for solving time and grid states, plus interactive visualization.

Tested on 6x6 grids with 5-7 color pairs, solving in under 1 second for most cases.

## üöÄ Features

- **Grid Management**: NxN matrix representation using NumPy for efficient operations.
- **Solver Engine**: Backtracking with priority queue for nearest empty cells, ensuring valid paths.
- **Validation Rules**: Checks for path connectivity, no overlaps, and grid completeness.
- **Visualization**: Pygame GUI displaying grids with colored rectangles (paths) and circles (dots).
- **Customization**: Easy modification of grid size and dot positions via input data.

|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Grid Size | Configurable NxN (e.g., 6x6) | ‚úÖ |
| Algorithm | Backtracking + Manhattan Heuristic | ‚úÖ |

- NumPy for array operations
- PyGame for GUI visualization
- Termcolor for colored console output

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dot-graph-solver.git
   cd dot-graph-solver
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **requirements.txt** contents:
   ```
   numpy>=1.21.0
   pygame>=2.0.0
   termcolor>=1.1.0
   ```

4. Run the solver (no additional setup needed; input data is defined in the script).

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

```
dot-graph-solver/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solver.py              # Main script with Dot and DotGraph classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file!
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                # MIT License
```

## üîß Usage

### 1. Run the Solver
Execute the script to solve a predefined puzzle and launch the GUI:
```bash
python solver.py
```

### 2. Customize Puzzles
Edit the `input_data` dictionary in `solver.py` to define new puzzles:
```python
input_data = {
    "green": [(0, 5), (4, 3)],
    "magenta": [(2, 1), (3, 5)],
    "red": [(4, 1), (3, 3)],
    "blue": [(5, 3), (4, 5)],
    "light_yellow": [(2, 2), (4, 4)],
}

# Create and solve
dot_graph = DotGraph(6, input_data)  # Grid size 6x6
dot_graph.show_solve_show()  # Console output with timing
dot_graph.display()          # Launch Pygame GUI
```

- **Grid Size**: Set via the first argument to `DotGraph` (must match coordinates).
- **Colors**: Use predefined colors like "red", "green", etc.; extend the colors dict in `display()` for more.

### 3. Outputs
- **Console**: Shows initial/final grid states with Unicode icons (‚óè for dots, ‚ñ† for paths) and solving time.
  Example:
  ```
  6x6, 5 colors
  [[‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚óè] ...]
  0.234 seconds
  [[‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚óè] ...]
  ```
- **GUI**: Interactive window displaying the solved grid. Close the window to exit.

## üìà Results & Performance

- **Solving Speed**: ~0.2-1.0 seconds for 6x6 grids with 5 colors.
- **Scalability**: Works for small-to-medium grids; larger ones may need optimization.
- **Accuracy**: Full validation ensures all paths connect without violations.

Challenges:
- Exponential complexity in backtracking for very large or constrained puzzles.
- GUI is display-only; future enhancements could add interactivity.
